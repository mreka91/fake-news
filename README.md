## Making a somewhat retro feel the Office US themed fake news site/blog with HTML, CSS and PHP as my first school project

## Feedback

- [x] You’re being inconsistent in your class names. You’re using kebab cases everywhere except in authors.php where you’re using snake cases. I recommend that you change all classnames to kebab case to be consistent.

- [x] Instead of repeating your code like you do in authors.php I would put all the information you want on the cards in your authors array and use foreach to loop trough it just like you do in index.php.

- [x] You don’t have alt attributes on your images, so maybe you could add that.

- [x]  Personally I would split the CSS into different files to make it easier to navigate.

- [ ]  Very well written comments!
